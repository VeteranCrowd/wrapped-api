# WrappedApi

The **WrappedApi** class creates a thin layer over an Axios object, intended to
standardize Axios usage and provide a consistent interface for logging and
ancillary services.

To install:

```
npm install https://github.com/VeteranCrowd/wrapped-api
```

See the
[AWS API Visa API](https://github.com/VeteranCrowd/aws-api/blob/dev/lib/networks/visa/api.js)
for a fully-worked example of usage, including async initialization and logging.
